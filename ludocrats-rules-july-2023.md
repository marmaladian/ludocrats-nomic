## Immutable Rules

### 101. 
All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).

### 102.
Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

### 103.
A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.

_(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no rule is absolutely immune to change.)_

### 105.
Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule-changes.

### 106.
All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on. If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were voted on.

### 107.
No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.

### 108.
Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

### 109.
Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take effect.

### 110.
In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not "conflict" with that immutable rule.

### 111.
If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and vote.

### 112.
The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.

### 113.
A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

### 114.
There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.

### 115.
Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

### 116.
Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.

## Mutable Rules

### 201. 
Players shall alternate in clockwise order, taking one whole turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.

In mail and computer games, players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname.

### 314. (202. amended by @Biggusniccus, reached quorum 5 votes to 1)
One turn consists of two parts in this order: 

(1) Either proposing one rule-change and having it voted on OR Taking a trip to the market and perform up to one market action.

(2) throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.

A market action is defined as either purchasing a piece of fruit OR adding a new piece of fruit to the market.  A piece of fruit may not be purchased by its donor until their next turn.

The decision to either propose a rule-change or go to the market must be made at the start of the turn and cannot be changed. 

In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract 291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favourable votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for more popular proposals.)

### 203.
A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority.

### 204.
If and when rule-changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10 points each.

### 205.
An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.

### 206.
When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.

### 207.
Each player always has exactly one vote.

### 208.
The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.

In mail and computer games, the winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.

### 209.
At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rules.

### 210.
Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule-changes unless they are team-mates.

The first paragraph of this rule does not apply to games by mail or computer.

### 211.
If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

### 212.
If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called invoking Judgment.

When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.

The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

### 213.
If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move cannot be determined with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player unable to complete a turn is the winner.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner. 

### 301. (proposed by @TiCranium, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
All rule change proposals must be made within 24 hours of being notified that is your turn following a completed vote on a proposal, or in the case of the first turn, within 24 hours of being notified that you are first player. The timer starts when the rule-keeper notifies the ‚Å†üìúÔΩúnomic channel with a @here message the result of the vote and the current status of the rules has been determined and updated if necessary. 

### 302. (proposed by @Biggusniccus, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
On a players turn, they may propose a draft form of the proposal to be debated and discussed in a thread dedicated to discussion of the proposal.  Only the final draft of a vote may be officially voted on.  The final draft shall be known to all as the final draft as it shall bear the branding [FINAL DRAFT] at the start.

Once the player has submitted a proposal with the branding, [FINAL DRAFT], no more discussion or debate may be entered into.

### 303. (proposed by @semyeotic, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
Upon the completion of a turn, the score a player rolls is added to the price at market of a random fruit.  If there are no fruits at market, no price change occurs.  For clarity, market price changes are not part of a player's turn, and whether they occur or not does not impact the completion of a turn.

### 304. (proposed by @marmaladian, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
Players must belong to either the Hall or the Chamber.

Players choose for themselves which of these they join initially.

Switching membership (e.g. from the Hall to the Chamber or vice versa) requires unanimous approval by the current members of the group (Hall or Chamber) the player wishes to join.

### 305. (proposed by @heaso, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
Nomic has been infected by The Plague. 

Any rules created or amended by a proposal must include the text ‚ÄúInfected by The Plague‚Äù at the end.

### 306. (transmutation of 104 to mutable proposed by @C.J., reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.

### 307. (proposed by @TiCranium, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
Every player must have nominated a "district" before the end of the second complete circuit of turns. From the third circuit of turns onwards, other players must refer to them as The Honorable Member for <District> if they are in the Hall, or The Honorable Representative of <District> if they are a member of the Chamber. The 'district' must be one dictionary or accepted slang word. If a player is referred to without the honorific the offending player sacrifices 1 (one) point to the player who was not referred to in the honorific.

### 308. (proposed by @Biggusniccus, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
While the concept of circut of turns exists (c.f rule 203), at the end of each circut of turns, beginning after the 2nd cycle, players will vote for "Nomicon of the round".

A thread will be made, where each player will nominate another for the title with a brief reason. Players are limited to one post each in the thread. Nominating one other player only.  The nominator must specify a particular rule change, proposal, or act of sportsmanship made by the nominee that positively impacted the game during the current cycle.

Once all players have voted, the winner and the nominator gain 5 points each.  In addition, the "Nomicon of the round" may immediately go to the market.

Neither votes or nominations are compulsory.  Each player can vote a maximum of one time, and not for their own nomination.

In the event of a tie, there will be no Nomicon of the round.

### 310. (proposed by @marmaladian, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
The Book of Promises maintains a list of agreements or promises between players to perform some (legal) game action(s) in the future, such as proposing a certain rule, voting in a certain way.

A promise is added when a player states their promise starting with the exact words "I Promise" (note capitalisation).

If the promise is not fulfilled, the player(s) that broke the promise are not permitted to propose a rule-change on their next turn (this supersedes rule 201 "parts of turns may not be omitted" and the parts of the turn detailed in rule 202).

Resolved (i.e. broken or fulfilled) promises are removed from the Book.

If there is any dispute about whether a promise has been broken or fulfilled, the Judge may be invoked to make a binding ruling on the dispute. If the Judge would be one of the players involved in the promise (a promisor or promisee) then the next player preceding the Judge who is not involved in the promise will be the Judge.

### 311. (proposed by @heaso, reached quorum 6 votes to 0)
At the end of the circuit and after Nomicon of the round (rule 308) has been completed the current points leader/s shall add a piece of fruit of their choosing to the market. 

The player can either add a new fruit to the market or an additional piece of existing fruit.

The fruit shall have the following attributes.
Name: Real or fictious
Initial Cost:  In points
Effect : The effect the fruit has including how it is triggered and who it effects.

If a player elects to add another piece of fruit already available in the market they may nominate a new initial price for that fruit.
